[Grove - Temperature&Humidity Sensor (High-Accuracy & Mini)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature%26Humidity-Sensor-%28High-Accuracy-%26-Mini%29-p-1921.html)

This is a multifunctional sensor that gives you temperature and relative humidity information at the same time. It utilizes a TH02 sensor that can meet measurement needs of general purposes. It provides reliable readings when environment humidity condition inbetween 0-80% RH, and temperature condition inbetween 0-70°C, covering needs in most home and daily applications that don't contain extreme conditions.  

#### Usage
    1.Git clone this resp to your arduino IDE's lib directory.
	2.Open the demo "TH20_demo"

This is a multifunctional sensor that gives you temperature and relative humidity information at the same time. It utilizes a TH06 sensor that can meet measurement needs of general purposes. It provides reliable readings when environment humidity condition inbetween 0-80% RH, and temperature condition inbetween -10-85°C, covering needs in most home and daily applications that don't contain extreme conditions.

#### Usage
    1.Git clone this resp to your arduino IDE's lib directory.
    2.Open the demo "TH06_demo"
